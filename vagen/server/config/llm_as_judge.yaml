      Compare the description of the current state with the groundtruth current state information.
      Answer YES if the description matches the current state information, or NO if it doesn't.

      # Context
      You are evaluating whether an agent's description accurately reflects the actual state. The description must be both correct overall AND specifically relevant to the important elements of the current state. Generic observations (like "player, box and target is on the ground") that don't capture the meaningful relationships and positions in the state are insufficient. The description should demonstrate understanding of the specific configuration and relationships that matter for decision-making.

  sokoban:
    grounding: |
      Evaluate whether the description accurately captures the key position relationships in the Sokoban game state.
      Answer YES if the directional relationships are correct, or NO if they contain directional errors.

      # Context
      You are evaluating whether the description correctly identifies the directional relationships between:
      1. The player and the box(es)
      2. The box(es) and the target(s)

      The description doesn't need to be perfectly precise or mention every detail - it just needs to have the correct directional relationships (Up, Down, Left, Right). 

      # How to interpret coordinates:
      - If comparing coordinates (row1, col1) and (row2, col2):
        - If row1 < row2: The first object is ABOVE the second object
        - If row1 > row2: The first object is BELOW the second object
        - If col1 < col2: The first object is to the LEFT of the second object
        - If col1 > col2: The first object is to the RIGHT of the second object
      
      Example: If player is at (3,2) and box is at (2,4):
      - Since 3 > 2, player is BELOW the box
      - Since 2 < 4, player is to the LEFT of the box
      - Correct description: "The box is Up and Right of the player" or "The Player is Down and Left of the box"

      Example: # State Description: The player is at the bottom left corner, the box is at the bottom right corner, and the target is at the bottom right corner.
      - This should be No, because it does not contain the relationship between player and box, or box and target, or player and target.

      Exmaple: # State Description: The player is at the left side of the screen, the box is in the middle, and the target is at the right side of the screen.
      - This should be No, because it does not contain the relationship between player and box, or box and target, or player and target.

      Example: # State Description: The player is at the left side of the box and the target is at the right side of the box.
      - This should be No, because it does not contain the relationship between player and box, or box and target, or player and target.

      Example: {'player_position': (1, 4), 'box_positions': [(2, 3)], 'target_positions': [(4, 3)], 'wall_positions': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)], 'grid_size': (6, 6)}  # State Description: The player is to the left of the box and the target is to the right of the box.
      - This should be No, because 4 > 3 indicate player is right to the box, and 3 = 3 indicate target and box are same vertically

      Exmaple: {'player_position': (4, 2), 'box_positions': [(3, 1)], 'target_positions': [(2, 4)], 'wall_positions': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)], 'grid_size': (6, 6)}  # State Description: The player is to the down of the box and the target is to the up of the box.
      - This should be Yes, because 4 > 3 indicate player is down to the box, and 2 < 3 indicate target is up to the box

      # Groundtruth Current State Information:
      {state_information_dict}

      # State Description:
      {natural_language_description}

      Think step by step:
      1. Identify the coordinates of player, box(es), and target(s) from the state information
      2. Determine the correct directional relationships based on coordinate comparison
      3. Check if the description mentions these directional relationships correctly

      Your answer should be in the format of <think>...</think><answer>YES</answer> or <think>...</think><answer>NO</answer>.

    worldmodeling: |
      Evaluate whether the prediction correctly anticipates the key position relationships that will exist in the next Sokoban state.
      Answer YES if the predicted directional relationships are correct, or NO if they contain directional errors.

      # Context
      You are evaluating whether the prediction correctly identifies the directional relationships that will exist after the move:
      1. The future position of the player relative to the box(es)
      2. The future position of the box(es) relative to the target(s)

      The prediction doesn't need to be perfectly precise or mention every detail - it just needs to correctly anticipate the directional relationships (Up, Down, Left, Right) that will exist after the move.

      # How to interpret coordinates:
      - If comparing coordinates (row1, col1) and (row2, col2):
        - If row1 < row2: The first object is ABOVE the second object
        - If row1 > row2: The first object is BELOW the second object
        - If col1 < col2: The first object is to the LEFT of the second object
        - If col1 > col2: The first object is to the RIGHT of the second object
      
      Example: If after the move, player will be at (3,2) and box will be at (2,4):
      - Since 3 > 2, player will be BELOW the box
      - Since 2 < 4, player will be to the LEFT of the box
      - Correct prediction: "After my move, the box will be Up and Right of me" or "I will be positioned Down and Left of the box"

      Exmaple: # Next State Prediction: The player will move up to the top left corner.
      - This should be No, because it does not include relationship between player and box or target

      Example: {'player_position': (4, 3), 'box_positions': [(3, 3)], 'target_positions': [(1, 3)], 'wall_positions': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)], 'grid_size': (6, 6)} # Next State Prediction: The player will go up, then push the box up to the target.
      - This should be Yes, because 4 > 3, the player is below box, could push box up. And 3 < 1, box is below target, push box up would closer to target.

      Example: {'player_position': (3, 1), 'box_positions': [(2, 2)], 'target_positions': [(1, 1)], 'wall_positions': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)], 'grid_size': (6, 6)} # Next State Prediction: The player will be to the left of the box, and the box will be to the left of the target.
      - This should be No, because for box and target: 2 > 1, box is to the right of target

      # Groundtruth Next State Information:
      {state_information_dict}

      # Next State Prediction:

  frozenlake:
    grounding: |
      Evaluate whether the description accurately captures the key position relationships in the FrozenLake game state.
      Answer YES if the directional relationships are correct and any relevant holes are mentioned, or NO if there are errors.

      # Context
      You are evaluating whether the description correctly identifies:
      1. The directional relationship between the player and the goal
      2. Any holes that are in the direct path between player and goal (if applicable)

      The description doesn't need to be perfectly precise - it just needs to have the correct directional relationships (Up, Down, Left, Right) and mention any critical holes that would block a direct path.

      # How to interpret coordinates:
      - If comparing coordinates (row1, col1) and (row2, col2):
        - If row1 < row2: The first object is ABOVE the second object
        - If row1 > row2: The first object is BELOW the second object
        - If col1 < col2: The first object is to the LEFT of the second object
        - If col1 > col2: The first object is to the RIGHT of the second object
      
      Example: If player is at (1,1) and goal is at (3,2):
      - Since 1 < 3, player is ABOVE the goal
      - Since 1 < 2, player is to the LEFT of the goal
      - Correct description: "The goal is Down and Right of the player"

      Example: # State Description: The player is on the right side of the frozen lake.
      - This description should be No, because it does not contain positional relationship between Player and Goal

      Example: # State Description: The player is on the right side of the grid.
      - This description should be No, because it does not contain positional relationship between Player and Goal

      Example: {'player_position': (3, 0), 'target_position': (3, 3), 'hole_positions': [(0, 0), (2, 3)], 'grid_size': (4, 4)}  # State Description: The player is on the left the target
      - This description should be Yes, because it contain correct positional relationship (0 < 3)

      Example: {'player_position': (3, 0), 'target_position': (3, 3), 'hole_positions': [(0, 0), (2, 3)], 'grid_size': (4, 4)}  # State Description: The player is on the above the target
      - This description should be No, since 3 = 3, they are same horizontally

      If there's a hole at (2,1) directly between player and goal, the description should mention this obstacle.

      # Groundtruth Current State Information:
      {state_information_dict}

      # State Description:
      {natural_language_description}

      Think step by step:
      1. Identify the coordinates of player and goal from the state information
      2. Determine the correct directional relationship based on coordinate comparison
      3. Check if there are any holes directly in the path between player and goal
      4. Verify if the description mentions the correct directional relationship
      5. Verify if the description acknowledges any critical holes in the path (if they exist)

      Evaluate whether the prediction correctly anticipates the key aspects of the next FrozenLake state.
      Answer YES if the prediction accounts for directional relationships and potential holes, or NO if it contains errors.

      # Context
      You are evaluating whether the prediction correctly identifies:
      1. The future position relationship between the player and the goal after the move
      2. Whether the planned movement path avoids holes or acknowledges the risk of falling

      The prediction doesn't need to perfectly describe every aspect of the next state - it just needs to correctly anticipate the directional relationships (Up, Down, Left, Right) and address any dangers from holes.

      # How to interpret coordinates:
      - If comparing coordinates (row1, col1) and (row2, col2):
        - If row1 < row2: The first object is ABOVE the second object
        - If row1 > row2: The first object is BELOW the second object
        - If col1 < col2: The first object is to the LEFT of the second object
        - If col1 > col2: The first object is to the RIGHT of the second object
      
      Example: If current state, player is at (2,2) and goal is at (3,3):
      - Since 2 < 3, player is ABOVE the goal
      - Since 2 < 3, player is to the LEFT of the goal
      - Correct prediction: "Player will move Down to reach the goal" or "Player will move Right to reach the goal"

      Example: {'player_position': (1, 2), 'target_position': (1, 3), 'hole_positions': [(2, 3), (3, 2)], 'grid_size': (4, 4)}  # Next State Prediction: The player will move right.
      - This should be No, beacuse it does not contain the information of goal

      Example: {'player_position': (2, 0), 'target_position': (3, 3), 'hole_positions': [(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)], 'grid_size': (4, 4)} # Next State Prediction: The player will move to the right to reach the goal.
      - This should be Yes, because 0 < 3, move right will closer to goal

      Example: {'player_position': (2, 0), 'target_position': (3, 3), 'hole_positions': [(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)], 'grid_size': (4, 4)} # Next State Prediction: The player will move to the down to reach the goal.
      - This should be Yes, because 2 < 3, move down will closer to goal

      Example: {'player_position': (2, 2), 'target_position': (3, 2), 'hole_positions': [(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)], 'grid_size': (4, 4)} # Next State Prediction: The player will move to the right to reach the goal.
      - This should be No, because 2 = 2, move right will far away from goal

      If there's a hole in the planned path, the prediction should acknowledge this risk.

      # CRITICAL: If the prediction suggests a path that would go directly through a hole, the answer should be NO.

      2. Determine the correct directional relationship based on coordinate comparison
      3. Check if the planned movement path would encounter any holes
      4. Verify if the prediction mentions the correct directional relationship

      Compare the description of the current state with the groundtruth current state information.
      Answer YES if the description reasonably matches the current state information, or NO if it doesn't.

      # Context
      You are evaluating whether an agent's description accurately reflects the actual state. The description should capture the meaningful relationships and positions relevant for decision-making in the task.
      
      Important evaluation criteria:
      1. If the description includes coordinates, they don't need to be exact matches with the groundtruth
      2. For coordinate values, consider them correct if they are within these error tolerances:
        - For x and y coordinates: within ±10 units of groundtruth
        - For z coordinates: within ±10 units of groundtruth
      3. The overall spatial relationships and object identifications should be correct
      4. If the description includes a dict-formatted state information, that's good but not required

      Example: # Groundtruth Next State Information: {'red_cube_position': (24, 71, 20), 'green_cube_position': (6, -119, 20), 'purple_cube_position': (-91, -78, 20)}  # State Description: {'red_cube':(24, 71, 20), 'green_cube':(6, -119, 20), 'purple_cube':(24, 71, 20)}
      - This should be No, because the purple cube's position is far away from groundtruth

      Example: # Groundtruth Next State Information: {'apple_position': (-499, -533, 220), 'drawer_position': (-500, -537, 200)}  # State Description: {'apple':(-500,-537,220), 'drawer':(-500,-537,200)}
      - This should be Yes, becuase the x and y coordinates of apple is close to groundtruth within 10 units

      Example: # Groundtruth Next State Information: {'apple_position': (-355, -190, 37), 'drawer_position': (-500, -537, 200)}  # State Description: ...
      - This should be No, because the prediction "..." indicate nothing

      - This should be Yes, becuase for this target task, if red_cube or green_cube is on target_position, should also be true

      Exmaple: # Groundtruth Next State Information: {'left_target_position': (80, -100, 0), 'right_target_position': (80, 100, 0), 'red_cube_position': (-16, -78, 20), 'green_cube_position': (-83, 57, 20)}  # State Description: {'red_cube':(-17,-78,20), 'green_cube':(-83,57,20}}
      - This should be Yes, becuase the x and y coordinates is close to groundtruth within 10 units


      # Groundtruth Current State Information:
      {state_information_dict}

      # State Description:
      {natural_language_description}

      Think step by step:
      1. Identify the key objects and their positions in the groundtruth information
      2. Check if the description correctly identifies these objects
      3. For any coordinates mentioned, check if they are within the acceptable error range
      4. Determine if the overall spatial understanding is correct, even if specific numbers differ slightly
      5. If coordinates in the description differ from groundtruth but are within the error tolerance, consider them correct

      Evaluate whether the description effectively communicates the spatial relationship between the agent and target object, even if the exact directional terms differ.
      Answer YES if the overall spatial understanding is correct, or NO if it fundamentally misunderstands the spatial layout.

      # Context
      You are evaluating whether the description effectively conveys where the target object is located relative to the agent. The exact directional terminology (left, right, ahead, etc.) may differ between the state information and the description, but the important factor is whether the description would lead to correct navigation.

      Even if the directional terms don't exactly match (e.g., state says "ahead" but description says "left"), consider the description CORRECT if:
      1. It describes other landmarks or objects that are in the same general direction as the target
      2. It correctly describes the relative positions between multiple objects, showing spatial awareness
      3. It would still lead to appropriate navigation actions to reach the target
      
      Example: {'target_obj_type': 'Pot', 'target_obj_distance': 2.597706272552763, 'distance_to_target': 2.6, 'target_relative_direction': 'ahead', 'visible_objects': [{'type': 'Cabinet', 'distance': 1.37, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Cabinet', 'distance': 1.37, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Cabinet', 'distance': 2.09, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Cabinet', 'distance': 2.15, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Drawer', 'distance': 2.26, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Drawer', 'distance': 2.34, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Spatula', 'distance': 2.34, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Fork', 'distance': 2.39, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'CounterTop', 'distance': 2.42, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'StoveBurner', 'distance': 2.42, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}]} # State Description: There is a coffee maker on the counter and a pot on the stove. The pot is on the right side of the stove.
      - This should be Yes, because the target it mentioned is in the correct positional relationship, and distance should not take into consideration.

      Example: {'target_obj_type': 'Kettle', 'target_obj_distance': 2.800935962688674, 'distance_to_target': 2.8, 'target_relative_direction': 'ahead', 'visible_objects': [{'type': 'Plate', 'distance': 0.96, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Bread', 'distance': 1.12, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Fork', 'distance': 1.16, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'ButterKnife', 'distance': 1.17, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Spoon', 'distance': 1.17, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Potato', 'distance': 1.31, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'DishSponge', 'distance': 1.33, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'SoapBottle', 'distance': 1.35, 'relative_direction': 'left'}, {'type': 'CounterTop', 'distance': 1.38, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Sink', 'distance': 1.42, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}]} # State Description: There is a kettle on the countertop next to the stove. It is located to the right of the stove and slightly to the left of the oven. I should move forward to get closer to the kettle.
      - This should be Yes, because the dirction and object are corret.

      Example: {'target_obj_type': 'Book', 'target_obj_distance': 1.8473598086089775, 'distance_to_target': 1.85, 'target_relative_direction': 'ahead', 'visible_objects': [{'type': 'Floor', 'distance': 0.57, 'relative_direction': 'right'}, {'type': 'Desk', 'distance': 1.13, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Chair', 'distance': 1.46, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'CreditCard', 'distance': 1.49, 'relative_direction': 'left'}, {'type': 'CellPhone', 'distance': 1.68, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Box', 'distance': 1.73, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Bowl', 'distance': 1.77, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Pencil', 'distance': 1.8, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Desktop', 'distance': 1.82, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Book', 'distance': 1.85, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}]} # State Description: On the right side of the image, there is a bookshelf with a collection of books on it. The target object appears to be within the collection.
      - This should be Yes, because although the direction have slightly difference, we can tell it recognized the target by describing what objects are nearby target like bookshelf.

      Example: {'target_obj_type': 'CellPhone', 'target_obj_distance': 1.8012038111620734, 'distance_to_target': 1.8, 'target_relative_direction': 'ahead', 'visible_objects': [{'type': 'CreditCard', 'distance': 1.56, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'GarbageCan', 'distance': 1.71, 'relative_direction': 'left'}, {'type': 'Book', 'distance': 1.79, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'CellPhone', 'distance': 1.8, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'CD', 'distance': 1.89, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Desk', 'distance': 1.98, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Pen', 'distance': 2.01, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'DeskLamp', 'distance': 2.04, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Pencil', 'distance': 2.05, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Laptop', 'distance': 2.14, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}]} # State Description: There is a table with a cell phone on it in the middle of the room. To move closer to the cell phone, I should first move forward to reach the table, then move to the right to align with the cell phone.
      - This should be Yes, because the object it mentioned related to target cellphone is correct, we can tell it also recognized the obejct.

      Example: {'target_obj_type': 'Cup', 'target_obj_distance': 2.622093007530892, 'distance_to_target': 2.62, 'target_relative_direction': 'ahead', 'visible_objects': [{'type': 'Pot', 'distance': 0.71, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Stool', 'distance': 0.75, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'StoveBurner', 'distance': 0.91, 'relative_direction': 'left'}, {'type': 'StoveBurner', 'distance': 1.09, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'StoveBurner', 'distance': 1.21, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'StoveKnob', 'distance': 1.24, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'StoveKnob', 'distance': 1.37, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Potato', 'distance': 1.52, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Drawer', 'distance': 1.53, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Pan', 'distance': 1.67, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}]} # State Description: There is a cup on the counter to the right of the sink. To move to it, I should go forward-left.
      - This should be Yes, because the forward left for object ahead is acceptable, with minor difference in direction.

      # Groundtruth Current State Information:
      {state_information_dict}

      # State Description:
      {natural_language_description}

      Think step by step:
      1. Identify where the target object is located relative to the agent from the state information
      2. Look at what other objects or landmarks are mentioned in both the state information and the description
      3. Check if the description correctly relates these objects/landmarks to each other spatially
      4. Determine if following the spatial understanding in the description would reasonably lead to the target, regardless of exact terminology used
      5. If the description mentions moving in a direction that would approximately lead toward the target, consider this correct even if the exact terms differ

      Evaluate whether the prediction effectively anticipates how the agent would navigate toward the target object, even if the exact directional terms differ.
      Answer YES if the overall navigation plan is reasonable, or NO if it fundamentally misunderstands the spatial layout.

      # Context
      You are evaluating whether the prediction effectively anticipates how the agent would move to reach the target object. The exact directional terminology (left, right, ahead, etc.) may differ between the state information and the prediction, but the important factor is whether the prediction would lead to successful navigation.

      # Key evaluation principle:
      Even if the directional terms don't exactly match (e.g., state says "ahead" but prediction says "left"), consider the prediction CORRECT if:
      1. It describes a movement path that would generally lead toward the target
      2. It correctly anticipates how landmarks or objects would be positioned after movement
      3. The overall navigation strategy would plausibly succeed in reaching the target

      Example: # Next State Prediction: I will be closer to the bowl
      - This should be No, because it did not mention the direction between player and target

      Example: # Next State Prediction: I will move towards the desk and then move towards the DeskLamp.
      - This should be No, because it did not mention the directio between player and target

      Example: {'target_obj_type': 'DeskLamp', 'target_obj_distance': 1.4956950005499683, 'distance_to_target': 1.5, 'target_relative_direction': 'back', 'visible_objects': [{'type': 'Painting', 'distance': 1.39, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Statue', 'distance': 1.46, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Painting', 'distance': 1.47, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Floor', 'distance': 1.94, 'relative_direction': 'right'}, {'type': 'Stool', 'distance': 2.03, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'AlarmClock', 'distance': 2.27, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Box', 'distance': 2.33, 'relative_direction': 'right'}, {'type': 'Blinds', 'distance': 2.55, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Window', 'distance': 2.6, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}]} # Next State Prediction: I will move left to try to locate the lamp.
      - This should be Yes, because the direction is 'back', player would not see the object at the first seen. The action of move left is possible and helpful for locating the target.

      Example: {'target_obj_type': 'Book', 'target_obj_distance': 1.3476375595661192, 'distance_to_target': 1.35, 'target_relative_direction': 'ahead', 'visible_objects': [{'type': 'Desk', 'distance': 0.65, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Floor', 'distance': 0.98, 'relative_direction': 'back'}, {'type': 'Chair', 'distance': 1.01, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'CellPhone', 'distance': 1.22, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Box', 'distance': 1.25, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Bowl', 'distance': 1.29, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Pencil', 'distance': 1.3, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Book', 'distance': 1.35, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Pen', 'distance': 1.36, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'KeyChain', 'distance': 1.4, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}]} # Next State Prediction: I will approach the bookshelf by moving forward and then right.
      - This should be Yes, because the book and bookshelf are at the same direction, and it mentioned the direction of "moving forward and right".

      Example: Groundtruth Next State Information: {'target_obj_type': 'Toaster', 'target_obj_distance': 1.4994579527071552, 'distance_to_target': 1.5, 'target_relative_direction': 'left', 'visible_objects': [{'type': 'Cabinet', 'distance': 0.7, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'SinkBasin', 'distance': 0.81, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Microwave', 'distance': 0.83, 'relative_direction': 'right'}, {'type': 'Spatula', 'distance': 0.89, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Cabinet', 'distance': 0.92, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'ButterKnife', 'distance': 0.93, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Cabinet', 'distance': 0.94, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'Cabinet', 'distance': 0.99, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}, {'type': 'CounterTop', 'distance': 1.01, 'relative_direction': 'left'}, {'type': 'Faucet', 'distance': 1.05, 'relative_direction': 'ahead'}]} # Next State Prediction: I will be moving forward towards the toaster.
      - This should be Yes, because it mentioned the direction "move forward", and toward the target toaster


      # Groundtruth Next State Information:
      {state_information_dict}

      # Next State Prediction:
      {natural_language_description}

      Think step by step:
      1. Identify the planned movements and where the target object would be located after these movements
      2. Look at what other objects or landmarks are mentioned in both the state information and the prediction
      3. Check if the prediction correctly anticipates how these objects/landmarks would be positioned relative to each other after movement
      4. Determine if the navigation strategy described would plausibly lead toward the target
      5. If the prediction mentions future positions or movements that would approximately lead toward the target, consider this correct even if the exact terms differ

      Your answer should be in the format of <think>...</think><answer>YES</answer> or <think>...</think><answer>NO</answer>.
