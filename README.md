We introduce **VAGEN**, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework designed specifically for training vision-language model (VLM) agents. Built upon this framework, we propose **Visual Reasoning RL**, a novel reinforcement learning approach that significantly improves the multi-turn performance of VLMs by explicitly supervising their visual state reasoning process, as shown in **Figure&nbsp;1**.

We frame multi-turn VLM agentic tasks as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), shown in **Figure&nbsp;2**.

## Why Visual Reasoning RL?
Standard RL methods applied to VLMs struggle with multi-turn agentic tasks due to:
1. **Visual State Ambiguity**: VLMs lack mechanisms to explicitly interpret and track evolving visual environments.
2. **Precision Bottlenecks**: Existing representations fall short in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial or temporal understanding.

Our approach, **Visual Reasoning RL**, addresses these challenges through:
1. **Visual State Reasoning Prompts**: Injects structured prompts like grounding (current state description) and world modeling (future state prediction) to scaffold the model’s internal reasoning.
2. **Reinforcement Learning with Reasoning Rewards**: Reinforces visual understanding with:
   - **Turn-level reasoning rewards** for supervising accuracy.
   - **Bi-Level GAE** for fine-grained credit assignment at both turn and token levels.
-->

## Problem Formulation
We frame multi-turn VLM agentic tasks as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), represented by the tuple $(S, O, \phi, A, p, r, \gamma),$ where $S$ denotes the set of environment states, and $O$ is the space of observations perceived by the agent.

Each observation $o_t \in O$ is a partial view of the environment state $s_t \in S$, given by the observation function $\phi$. The agent’s objective is to learn a policy $\pi_\theta$ that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted return:

$$
\max_{\theta}\mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta,p}\left[\sum_{t=1}^{T} \gamma^{t-1} r_t \right].
$$

In our setting, the policy $\pi_\theta$ is parameterized by a VLM that takes visual images (with prompts) as observations, and outputs language token sequences as actions.


## Why Visual Reasoning RL?
Standard RL methods applied to VLMs struggle with multi-turn agentic tasks due to:
1. **Visual State Ambiguity**: VLMs lack mechanisms to explicitly interpret and track evolving visual environments.
2. **Precision Bottlenecks**: Existing representations fall short in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial or temporal understanding.

Our approach, **Visual Reasoning RL**, addresses these challenges through:

### Boost #1: World Modeling

1. **Reasoning Prompts**: Injects structured world modeling prompts (future state prediction) to scaffold the model’s internal reasoning.

   - **WorldModeling: Combined current and future state reasoning**  
     ```text
     <think><observation>...</observation>...<prediction>...</prediction></think><answer>...</answer>
     ```
2. **Reasoning Rewards**: We use LLM-as-Judge to reward the agent when its predicted or observed visual state matches the ground truth.


### Boost #2: Bi-Level GAE
To address the limitation of only providing trajectory-level feedback, we propose **Bi-Level GAE**, which delivers fine-grained turn-level reward signals. This approach assigns rewards at the end of each action and introduces two discount factors: one for tokens within a turn, and one for transitions across turns.

## Key Innovations of VAGEN

Two key innovations are introduced in VAGEN to support methods like Visual Reasoning RL:

1. **Selective Token Masking** - Focuses optimization on action-critical tokens through:
   - Loss masking (`M^loss`): Identifies tokens to update during policy optimization
   - Advantage masking (`M^adv`): Determines tokens to include in advantage calculations

2. **Cross-turn Credit Assignment** - Enables more effective credit attribution through:
   - Bi-level advantage estimation with separate discount factors for cross-turn (`γ_turn`) and within-turn (`γ_token`) calculations
   - Turn-level rewards applied at each interaction boundary

## Why VAGEN Works Better for VLM Agents

Traditional RL frameworks for LLM agents treat all tokens in a trajectory equally. This approach is suboptimal for VLM agents due to:

- **Distribution Shift**: Most VLMs aren't pretrained to generate image tokens
- **State Redundancy**: Visual tasks contain excessive low-level information in long-context inputs

VAGEN addresses these challenges by focusing optimization on the most critical decision-making tokens and creating a more nuanced reward structure across interaction turns.

## The VAGEN Workflow

We present the workflow of **VAGEN** in the image below. The `rollout.py` module facilitates interactions between `ray_trainer.py` and various environments. Our framework operates with two forms of “language”: token sequences (used by the model) and structured information from the environments. `rollout.py` serves as a translator, parsing structured environment data into tokens for the model and converting model outputs back into structured actions or observations. It also records data of each step to form the entire trajectory.

## How to Add New Environment and Services

See our [Creating Environments](./docs/envs/create-env.md) guide. You may also want to check our [Creating Service](./docs/envs/create-service.md) for scaling your environments.

## How to Add New Model

1. Refer to [VERL](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for adding new MLLM.
2. Refer to [QwenVLRolloutManager](vagen/rollout/qwen_rollout/rollout_manager.py) to understand how rollout works. In most cases, you can use QwenVLRolloutManager directly with only minor modifications to the model's special tokens

## Experimental Results
We benchmark closed- and open-sourced models on five environments. We find explicitly visual states reasoning is crucial for VLM agents.

- Bi-Level GAE alone brings notable but unstable improvements, being sensitive to reward sparsity and less stable in sparse environments.
- The WorldModeling Reward alone consistently boosts performance by providing essential visual learning signals, but is limited by coarse credit assignment.
- VAGEN-Full is the most robust and achieves strong, stable results across all tasks.


<!--
Incorporating **Visual Reasoning RL** leads to improved performance.
- VAGEN-Base uses the Grounding-WorldModeling reasoning strategy along with format and task-specific rewards.
- VAGEN-Full builds on this and incorporates Visual Reasoning RL
